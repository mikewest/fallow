A few days ago, my landlord asked me if I was losing hair.

<img src='/images/3.jpg' alt='I look nothing like this.' style='float:left; margin-right:1em;' />

Today, Antonia told me that I bear a striking resemblance to a picture of  [Warren Zevon][wz] that was on the [homepage of Yahoo! Music][ymusic]...  "not quite so drug-addicted, but in that direction."

I think she meant it as a compliment, but that just casts sincere doubts on her taste in men.   According to Wikipedia, he was dying of cancer at the time.  I don't particularly want to look like this picture.

I'm not sure if I should run out and shave, get an immediate haircut, and new glasses, or just be depressed about the whole thing.
